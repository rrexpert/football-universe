<h1>Pilot Project 2005</h1>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">In 2005 - as a pilot project - a pavilion was set up on-site at all our football schools. Here the parents could meet having a cup of coffee while their children were playing on the pitch. Some schools even organised more formally structured meetings for parents, but we do not consider these initiatives entirely successful. In other words, we believe, we need a more systematic and well elaborated approach to this matter. Consequently, as a new initiative we have prepared a 3-hours interactive workshop module for some 20-40 parents to be held at each Open Fun Football School this summer (2006). Thematically, the workshop takes off in “Roles and Functions” i.e. looking at “Why it is good that children play football? - seen from the perspective of the child, the parent, the coach, the football clubs and the municipal authorities”. Based on these discussions the work extends into identifying “Problems and Possibilities”.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
