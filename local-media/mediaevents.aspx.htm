<h1>Media Events and Press Conferences</h1>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">Generally speaking, all Open Fun Football Schools enjoy great media attention in local television stations, radio and newspapers. </font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
<p>
</p>
<img src="../graphics/girl.gif" alt="" />
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">In each country we also arrange 2-6 yearly press conferences that are covered by the national media. In certain countries we are having special agreements with different news agencies. For instance, in Bosnia Herzegovina throughout July and August the biggest national newspaper “Novi Avaz” is posting a full “double page” with interviews, reports, pictures and features from the Open Fun Football Schools twice weekly. Further, our office in Bosnia Herzegovina is also enjoying monthly coverage throughout the whole year in the children’s magazine “Vesela Sveska” – a magazine that is distributed to all children of Bosnia Herzegovina. In Serbia Montenegro our office has a special agreement with the SOS Sports Channel – broadcasting every day throughout August from our Open Fun Football Schools etc.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">A special media event in 2005/2006 has been the production and publishing of the film “The Football School” that was produced by the Danish Production Company, “Spor Media”. The film was shot in the town of Jajce (BiH) during the spring 2005 and it is sold in 8 countries. In Denmark the opening ceremony was, amongst others, attended by HRH Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and HRH Crown Prince Håkon of Norway. Further, in Norway the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs attended a 20 minutes introductory program before the film was broadcasted – the minister discussed the ways Norway can make use of projects like Open Fun Football Schools in their foreign policy.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">Again, other schools have drawn special attention due to visits of dignitaries i.e. Lars-Christer Olsson, CEO UEFA visited a Fun Football School in the Georgian town of Mshreta and Sir Bobby Charlton visited the Open Fun Football School in Foca (BiH).</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
