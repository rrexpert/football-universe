<img src="../graphics/sittinggirlsmall.gif" alt="" />
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">During the past years we have witnessed a substantial increase in grassroots football activities in all the countries, we are involved in. Correspondingly, the challenge today is to encourage a viable and sustainable local grassroots structure within the framework of the National Football Associations.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
<p>

</p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">The Senior Leaders Follow-up Education is a follow up education that was organised by Cross Cultures in cooperation with the Football Association of Norway and the Danish Sports Federation (DIF). The Follow-up Education is targeting three key persons in the various countries. One is appointed by the National FA and the remaining two by CCPA.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p> 
<p>

</p>
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">The objective is to provide the key persons with a theoretical and practical knowledge of how to run a project that will help promote building viable and sustainable grassroots football structures. Building on the participantsâ€™ background, knowledge and network, the training is tailored to develop individual vocational and leadership qualification.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
