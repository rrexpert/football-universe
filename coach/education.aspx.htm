<h1>Three Levels of Education</h1>

<img src="../graphics/clubsboy.gif" alt="" />
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">We organize three types of regional seminars. The common denominator of all our seminars is the specific focus of attention: We put the children first; secondly, it is our thesis that it is the environment that connects children with the game and the clubs:</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<ul>
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3"><u>Coach seminars</u><BR> (3 days duration): The coaches are the ones training all the children on the pitch. The coaches are introduced to the underlying values and ideas of the Open Fun Football Schools and receive training in a wide range of exercises, the focus of which is the fun elements of the game.</font face="verdana" size="3"></li> 
</ul>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">The coach education is designed in three modules:</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
<ol>
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3">Theory (a three day educational seminar) – 30 hours</font face="verdana" size="3"></li>
<p>
</p>	
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3">Practise (participation in a five day open Fun Football School) – 30 hours</font face="verdana" size="3"></li>
<p>
</p>	
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3">Individual feed back (provided by the local OFFS-instructor)</font face="verdana" size="3"></li>
</ol>

<p>
</p>
<img src="../graphics/sittinggirlsmall.gif" alt="" />
<p><font face="verdana" size="3">Hence, the Cross Cultures Grassroots Certificate includes 60 hours training plus  individual evaluation/feed back. It is a set-up that fulfils the general requirements as stated in the UEFA Grassroots Charter.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<ul>
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3"><u>Leader seminars</u><BR> (5 days duration): The school leaders are responsible for the implementation of the schools. They are the ones making all the necessary local arrangements, recruitment of coaches and children and organising the school. They go through the same education as the one of the coaches plus two additional days the main topic of which are “How to create a good children environment”.</font face="verdana" size="3"></li>
<p>
</p>
	<li><font face="verdana" size="3"><u>Instructor seminars</u><BR> (5-8 days duration): Our instructors constitute the backbone of the project Open Fun Football Schools. They are our link to the societies and, as such, the Open Fun Football Schools’ ambassadors within the local communities. The instructors are trained to conduct the training at leader- and coach seminars (“train –the-trainers”). Also, they are tasked to monitor the football schools and give feed back to all leaders and coaches in order to secure and develop the quality of our operation.</font face="verdana" size="3"></li>
