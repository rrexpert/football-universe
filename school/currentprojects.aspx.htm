<h1>School Sports in Bosnia,Maceonia, Armenia and Georgia</h1>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">During autumn 2005 our office in Bosnia and Herzegovina initiated a number of “Leisure Time Fun Football” activities in cooperation with elementary schools. The programme included six schools with 50 children each i.e. boys and girls between 7 and 12 years who were supervised and trained by experienced leaders and coaches twice weekly.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">In Macedonia a “Fun School Sport Program”, exclusively funded by the Norwegian Government, has been established in cooperation with the National School Sports Organisation. The objective is to make our “Fun-Concept” part of the daily curriculum in all primary schools in 4 selected municipalities.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">Also in Georgia and Armenia Open Fun Football Schools branch offices have initiated an extensive school sport programme involving elementary as well as secondary schools.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">Beside the Fun School Sport Program in Macedonia, all activities are organised by teachers who have joined the Open Fun Football Schools and who are using equipment from our operation.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>

<p><font face="verdana" size="3">This being said, a more systematic approach to the schools sports platform remains to be developed.</font face="verdana" size="3"></p>
